# User Documentation
Introducing Sociable, a chat app that’s similar to Messenger or Whatsapp but one that’s more geared for social interaction. The application would support many of the same features as your typical chatting app such as adding contacts/friends, sending messages to other users, group chat capabilities etc. However, Sociable would also share a robust set of features that would enhance the social component of the application. Some of these features include allowing users to see and connect with mutual friends, creating profiles complete with bios and pictures, post statuses, seeing other users on a map and interacting with them via location-based chat. The idea is to create a more robust messaging application that enhances the social component of the user’s overall experience.

## Project Description

## Installation
[TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) is needed to install the app and requires iOS 13.0. 
An invitation is required and is forwarded via email.

At the moment, iOS 15.0 is the minimum version required to run the Sociable app. 

After accepting the invitation, Sociable Messenger should be ready to install under Apps. Please reach out if you have any issues.

## How to Run
After installation, the app should be able to open when you click on it and work just like any other iOS app. 

## How to Use
Like any other iOS mobile application, once you open the app, you will see the login screen. 

Login and account creation - You enter the usename and password and click on "Login" button. In order to create a new account, you can click on "Create Account" button and can fill the name, password and birthday; finally clicking on "Register" to register the account. In the login creen, there is also the option of "Forgot Password?" which takes you to another screen where you can reset your password by submitting your email address. Lastly, you can switch back to the login screen from any of the "create login" screen or the "forgot password" screen using the "back" button on the top left corner. 

Messaging - Once you are logged in, you can select any contacts' name and start a chat with them. Type in the message in the message box and hit send. Like any other chat window, you will be able to see their messages and your own on that screen with the name and photo of your contact displayed on the top left corner.

Posting story/status - Functionality is work in progress

Adding friends - Functionality is work in progress
