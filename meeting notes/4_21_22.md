# Meeting Notes for 4/21/22

## Figma and Swift Conversion
- Thereâ€™s already modern messenger UI screens on Figma that we can use to implement as our app screens
- There are Figma to Swift conversion tools that may help streamline the process without needing to build from "scratch"
  - We are currently going to experiment with [Monday Hero](https://mondayhero.io/tutorials/figma/export-to-swift)
  - **Figma has iOS code that we can use** (access w/ account) - we will be referencing this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Q3tWclyoJOFp5CqFbJ2xlb/Messaging-App-UI-(Community))
- We can tweak screens after putting in converted Figma elements to fit our app theme

## App Logo
It may be best if we gather as a group and whiteboard what the app logo should look like.

## Goals for this week
- Figure out Monday Hero to see if it will work well with converting Figma screens to Xcode
- Screens have been assigned to be implemented on Xcode:
  - Kevin: signup/login flow
  - Abas/Sulaiman: messaging/DMs & integrating with the backend or creating dummy/test functions for sending/receiving messages
  - Riya: my profile/statuses
