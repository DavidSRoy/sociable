# Status Report 7: `06/01/2022`

## Team Status
We have released our app (version 7). We are using TestFlight to distribute our final release (ie. there is no public link, as this would require a review by the App Store and would take extra time.) We were able to address most of the issues addressed during our peer review, including messages not sending and disfunctional login.
## Sub-team Status

### Backend Team
David & Anna

We added extra endpoints as requested by the frontend team. This includes endpoints for adding and removing friends and setting a profile photo and bio. We also made changes to the `getUsers` endpoint upon request. We also updated the function deployment pipeline so that it could access our service account details during the deployment.
